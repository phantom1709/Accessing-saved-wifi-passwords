# Accessing-saved-wifi-passwords
# Most computers/laptops nowadays have built in wifi cards. These cards can remember all the networks and passwords that our system has been connected to. I have built a tool which can access network names and passwords of a system remotely. This tool is used a lot by people in cyber security field. I have built it using python.
